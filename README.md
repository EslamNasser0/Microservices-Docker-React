# 🚀 Dockerized Microservices App

A simple **microservices-based application** built with **React, Node.js, Postgres, Redis, and Nginx**, all orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.  

This project demonstrates how to structure, containerize, and run a full-stack app with background jobs, caching, and reverse proxying.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📦 **Microservices architecture** – modular and scalable.
- ⚡ **React frontend** – modern UI for users.
- 🔗 **Node.js API** – REST backend with Express.
- 🗄️ **Postgres database** – reliable relational storage.
- 🧠 **Redis** – fast cache + job queue.
- 🔄 **Worker service** – background job processing.
- 🌐 **Nginx reverse proxy** – routes requests between frontend and backend.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
````

### 2. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 3. Access the app

* Client: [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050)
* API: routed internally through `/api`
* React dev server (optional): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

* React client runs in **development mode** (`react-scripts start`).
* API and Worker use **nodemon** for auto-reloading.
* Nginx handles reverse proxying between client and server.

To create a **production build** of the client:

```bash
docker exec -it <client-container> npm run build
```

---

## 🧩 Environment Variables

Key variables (set in `docker-compose.yml`):

**Postgres**

* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_password`

**API**

* `PGUSER=postgres`
* `PGPASSWORD=postgres_password`
* `PGHOST=postgres`
* `PGDATABASE=postgres`

This way:  
- **Users** can quickly see what the app is, what it does, and screenshots.  
- **Developers** have all the setup, architecture, and environment details.  

👉 Do you want me to also create a **badges section** (like build status, license, Docker pulls, etc.) for the very top? That often makes READMEs look more professional.
